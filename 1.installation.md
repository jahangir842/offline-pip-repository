## Setting Up an Offline PIP Server on Ubuntu

---

### Step 1: Installation of PIP

   - PIP can be installed by installing [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).
   - You can also install Miniconda on linux with following command:

```
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```


2. **Initialize Conda**:
   ```bash
   ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init
   ```

3. **Activate Conda**:
   ```bash
   ~/miniconda3/bin/conda activate
   ```

4. **Verify Installation of pip**

   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

## Step 2: Downloading Python Packages

To download and install Python packages specified in a `requirements.txt` file using `pip` on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

#### Prepare the `requirements.txt` File

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
   Open a terminal and change to the directory containing your `requirements.txt` file using the `cd` command. Execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   mkdir packages
   cd packages
   nano requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Add Package Names:**
   Write the names of the packages you want to download in the `requirements.txt` file. For example:
   ```
   pandas
   numpy
   flask
   wheel
   ```

---

### Method 1: Download Binary Packages:

#### Download Linux Binary Package

Run the following command to download the specified package in `Binary` format e.g requests:
```bash
pip download numpy --platform manylinux1_x86_64 --python-version 3.12 --only-binary=:all:

```

#### Download Linux Binary Package with Requirement File

Run the following command to download the specified package in `Source Code` e.g requests:
```bash
pip download --platform manylinux1_x86_64 --python-version 3.12 --only-binary=:all: -r requirements.txt
```

#### Download Windows Binary Package

Run the following command to download the specified package in `Binary` format e.g requests:
```bash
pip download numpy --platform win_amd64 --python-version 3.12 --only-binary=:all:
```

#### Download windows Binary Package with Requirement File

Run the following command to download the specified package in `Source Code` e.g requests:
```bash
pip download --platform win_amd64 --python-version 3.12 --only-binary=:all: -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Method 2: Download Source Code Packages: (This method has dependency issues yet)

#### Download Source Code Packages with Requirement File

Run the following command to download the specified packages:
```bash
pip download --no-binary :all: --python-version 3.12 -r requirements.txt
```

#### Download Source Code Packages with Requirement File

Run the following command to download the specified packages:
```bash
pip download --no-binary :all: --python-version 3.12 -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Setting Up the Python Server with Local Network

   - Connect the PC to the Local Network.
   - Configure the IP address accordingly.
   - Navigate to packages directory and start a Simple HTTP Server with following command.

   ```bash
   cd /home/pip/packages
   python -m http.server 80 --bind 192.168.1.109
   ```

---

## Step 3: Installing Python Packages on the Client Side via pip

Create a new Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.12
```

Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name and `3.12` with the version of Python you want to use.

### To Activate the Environment:
```bash
conda activate myenv
```

### To Deactivate the Environment:
```bash
conda deactivate
```

#### Verify pip Installation

To check if pip is installed on Ubuntu, run:
```bash
pip --version
```

#### Update pip (Optional)

Make sure you have the latest version of pip by running:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Installation Options

**Option 1: Install Packages Directly**

Open a terminal and run the following command to install a specific library, such as `pandas`:
```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=http://192.168.1.109:80 --trusted-host 192.168.1.109 numpy
```
- Replace the IP with actual address.
  
**Option 2: Install Packages from `requirements.txt`**

Create a new `requirements.txt` file and list the libraries you need. Then run:
```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=http://192.168.1.109:80 --trusted-host 192.168.1.109 -r requirements.txt
```

### To List Installed PIP Packages:
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip list
```

### To Uninstall a PIP Package:
Use the following command, replacing `package_name` with the name of the package you want to uninstall:
```bash
pip uninstall package_name
```

You will be prompted to confirm the uninstallation. If you want to skip the prompt, add the `-y` flag:
```bash
pip uninstall -y package_name
```

### Next Steps
Here are a few things you might want to consider doing next:

1. **Access the File via Browser**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/test.txt`. You should be able to view the contents of the `test.txt` file.

2. **Add More Files**:
   If you want to serve more files, you can simply place them in the `pip-packages` directory on your host machine. They will automatically be available in the Nginx server.

3. **Check Nginx Configuration**:
   If you have specific requirements for how files are served or if you need to set up routing or reverse proxy settings, review your Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`). Make sure it meets your needs.

4. **Test Other Features**:
   Depending on what you plan to do with your offline pip repository, you might want to test other features like:
   - Serving multiple files or directories.
   - Configuring error handling.
   - Implementing security measures if the server will be exposed beyond localhost.

5. **Documentation**:
   If this setup is for a project or future reference, document your configuration and setup steps for easy recall later.
